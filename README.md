# Vaccination Rates Analysis for Preventable Childhood Diseases in Nigeria

## 1. Business Understanding
### 1.2 Problem Statement
The Nigerian Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was initiated in 1979. There was
progress in the 1980s and since then, the vaccination coverage has then stagnated. The real
goal is to make sure that all children under one year old are fully immunised at a rate of 90
percent nationally and at least 80 percent in each state.
